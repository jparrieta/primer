If you pass False, you will be given a goodbye message.  \n",

If the input is either \"Guten Morgen\" pr \"Ich liebe dich\" then the function will output a known translation. If the input was anything else, the function will call itself again. This will continue forever until a known phrase is given. This behavior is similar to a while-statement but instead of a while-statement it uses something called recursion. The function calls itself indefinitely until the user does something to break the loop.  \n",
    "If you do not want to be stuck in the recursive loop, you can give input an integer to the function or avoid giving a value. The function will then run for 5 times if no value was given or for the number of times you provided. The function here instead uses a dictionary to translate between German and French. The dictionary has two entries, the same as above. After the dictionary is stored, a for-loop starts. It asks for an input and if the input is part of the keys of the translator then it prints the translation. If not, the function passes and the for-loop increases by one.

    "Thank you for taking your time and using this tutorial. We have gone through the basics of programming in Python, with this you should be able to go on your own and explore. There are many longer tutorials, and starter projects that will teach you how to program more. Feel free to look on your own. One thing you will learn while programming is that any problem you have at the moment was a problem someone had before. Ask Google for help, there is a larger community that has posted answers to your questions.  \n",
