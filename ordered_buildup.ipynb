    "In the example, I exploit option 0 then explore option 3, then explore option 2. On these ocassions, the bandit dictionary is expanded. Then I do two other explorations but now with bandits that I have already explored before. Therefore, the bandits are not added. In the last step, I choose option 1 and it is added as the last bandits. \n",

    "I break the for-loop just there and output the log of bandits. AS you can see, the order of the bandits is given as the choice of the example. 0 to 0, 1 to 3, 2 to 2 and 3 to 1. With this log then I can translate the choices. Instead of 0 0 3 2 3 2 1 the bandits actually used were 0 0 1 2 1 2 3. By doing this, then the process can be transparent to data analysis. \n",
